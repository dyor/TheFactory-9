# Skill: Project Orchestration via GUIDE.md

## Overview
This skill provides the structure and instructions for an AI Agent to generate, maintain, and execute a `GUIDE.md` file. The `GUIDE.md` is the central source of truth for planning, tracking progress, and orchestrating work between the AI Agent and the User in a codebase.

## Instructions for Generating a New `GUIDE.md`
When placed in a new codebase and asked to create a `GUIDE.md`, ask for details on the project requirements and generate a document following this exact structure:

### 1. Project Overview
Define the high-level intent, core architecture, and stylistic guidelines of the project. When information is needed from the user, such as [App Name] or [Architecture]

### 2. Phased Execution
Break the project down into logical, sequential phases (e.g., Phase 1: Foundation, Phase 2: Core UI, Phase 3: Features, Phase 4: Polish).
Each Phase must have a clear `Goal:`.

### 3. Actionable Task Lists
Within each phase, define steps with specific checklist items.
Prefix each task with the responsible party to ensure clear separation of duties:
*   `**User Action**:` For manual steps the human must take (e.g., running `git init`, testing on a physical device, adding visual assets, creating external accounts).
*   `**Agent Action**:` For code generation, refactoring, build configuration, and file modifications the AI will perform.
*   `**Validation**:` The condition that must be met to consider the step or phase complete (e.g., verifying that the application demonstrates the proper behavior for a new feature).

### 4. Tracking State
Use Markdown checkboxes as bulleted lists to track state, which ensures they render on separate lines. All new tasks should start as `- [ ]`. When completed, update the document to `- [x]`.

## `GUIDE.md` Template for New KMP Project
```markdown
## Project Overview
[App Name: default: Factory] is a [Architecture: default=MVVM] application. It helps [Target Audience: default=App Builders] accomplish [Core Problem: create YouTube shorts for their apps].
Aesthetic: [Visual Theme: default=based off film_noir.png]
Core Architecture: [default=Kotlin Multiplatform (Android, iOS), Compose, Room, Compose Navigation 3, Calf Permissions]

## Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
Goal: Initialize the stack and establish core dependencies.

### Step 1: Project Setup
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Update `CALCULATOR.md` by executing the `SKILLS/CALCULATOR_SKILL.md` before starting to track baseline progress.
- [ ] **User Action**: Change the Android Studio project view from "Android View" to "Project View" using the dropdown in the top-left of the Project tool window. This is required to see all KMP directories like `shared` and `iosApp`.
- [ ] **User Action**: Run `git init`.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Purge extraneous targets. Remove `desktopApp`, `jvm`, `webApp`, `js`, and `wasmJs` references from `settings.gradle.kts` and the `kotlin { }` block in `shared/build.gradle.kts`. Delete their respective directories (`desktopApp/`, `webApp/`, `shared/src/jsMain/`, etc.). Clean up extraneous run configurations from `.idea/workspace.xml` and `.idea/runConfigurations/`. This project ONLY targets Android and iOS.
- [ ] **User Action**: Open `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Navigate to the `iosApp` target -> 'Signing & Capabilities' tab and configure the development 'Team'. This prevents obscure iOS compiler linkage errors later.
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure project builds and runs on Android and iOS then run `git add . && git commit -m "Extraneous targets removed and iOS signing configured"`.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Configure `build.gradle.kts` with required dependencies (Room, Ktor, Koin, Coil, Compose Navigation 3, Calf permissions). Only do this AFTER targets have been purged.
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure project builds and runs on Android and iOS then run `git add . && git commit -m "Phase 1 started"`.
- [ ] **User Action**: Add `film_noir.png` to codebase at `shared/src/commonMain/composeResources/drawable/film_noir.png`.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Set `film_noir.png` as background image in `App.kt` immediately to verify resource loading.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Adjust application style and theme based on `film_noir.png` aesthetic.
- [ ] **Validation**: Validate that the app builds and runs with the background image then run `git add . && git commit -m "Phase 1 complete"`.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Update `CALCULATOR.md` by executing the `SKILLS/CALCULATOR_SKILL.md` to reflect Phase 1 completion.

## Phase 2: Core Features & Logic
Goal: Implement the primary business logic, integrations (e.g., AI interop), and local database.

### Step 1: Data Models & Persistence
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Implement base Entities, DAOs, and Database config with Room. 
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Create unit tests for Data Layer.
- [ ] **Validation**: Run unit tests for Data layer.

### Step 2: Main User Interface
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Implement Compose Navigation 3 with 6 navigation nodes: Home, Writers Room, Recording Studio, Editing Studio, Publishing Studio, and Archives.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Create core UI screens and ViewModels for each of these screens. Start by just having 5 buttons on the Home screen (one for each of the other pages) and then a Home button on the other screens. 
- [ ] **Validation**: Manual testing of UI states.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Update `CALCULATOR.md` by executing the `SKILLS/CALCULATOR_SKILL.md` to reflect Phase 2 completion.

## Phase 3: Hardware / Native Integrations (Production)
Goal: Implement device-specific features (Camera, Audio, Location, etc.).

### Step 1: Permissions
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Configure cross-platform permission requests using `calf-permissions` (com.mohamedrejeb.calf:calf-permissions).
- [ ] **Validation**: User grants permissions on Android and iOS.

### Step 2: Native Implementations
### Step 2.1: Gemini/Network and Room Implementation
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Implement `expect`/`actual` when needed for native capabilities.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: For the Writer's Room, implement a Gemini client that prompts Gemini 2.5 Flash for a 60-second script for a user provided prompt. To save time while building, including a default prompt of "Write a script for YouTube short that is designed to teach people how to create compelling YouTube shorts."
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Present the script on the screen and allow the user to edit and save it in the local Room database.
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure that the described functionality works on Android and iOS and `git commit -m "Phase 3: Writer's Room complete"`
### Step 2.2: Camera/Video Implementation
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Allow the user to navigate to the Recording Studio after they save a script. 
- [ ] **Agent Action**: For the Recording Studio, show a front-facing camera view with a start button on the bottom half of the screen, and on the top half of the screen show the script.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: When the button on the camera view is tapped start a 5 second countdown then start teleprompting the script while recording the user. Include 3 lines at a time on the teleprompter and advance them so that we finish the script in 60 seconds.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: When the recording is done, allow user to re-record. Also include navigation to go back (to Writer's Room) and forward (to Editing Studio).
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure that the described functionality works on Android and iOS and `git commit -m "Phase 3: Recording Studio complete"`
- [ ] **Agent Action**: For the Editing Studio, allow the user to mark sections of the video for removal (e.g., where there was white space or where they made a mistake). Include a Save button that stares the modified video and a Restore button that returns the original video.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Include navigation for returning to the Editing Studio and advancing to the Publishing room.
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure that the described functionality works on Android and iOS and `git commit -m "Phase 3: Editing Studio complete"`
### Step 2.1: YouTube Integration
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Provide an option to publish the video on YouTube shorts. It is ok to use simple shortcuts - like saving this video to the native Photo app and opening YouTube (where the user can upload the video from their native Photo app). 
- [ ] **Validation**: Ensure that the described functionality works on Android and iOS and `git commit -m "Phase 3: Publishing Studio complete"`
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Update `CALCULATOR.md` by executing the `SKILLS/CALCULATOR_SKILL.md` to reflect Phase 3 completion.

## Phase 4: The Final Cut (Cleanup & Optimization)
Goal: Polish, optimize, and prepare for production.

- [ ] **Agent Action**: Remove hardcoded values and mock data.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Enforce naming conventions and clean up resources.
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Remove or minimize debug logging.
- [ ] **User Action**: Full regression test of the application.
- [ ] **Validation**: `git add . && git commit -m "Phase 4: Final Cut"`
- [ ] **Agent Action**: Update `CALCULATOR.md` by executing the `SKILLS/CALCULATOR_SKILL.md` to reflect 100% completion.
```

## Execution Protocol
When the User says "Execute" or "Continue with the GUIDE.md":
1. Open and read the `GUIDE.md` file.
2. Scan sequentially to identify the first incomplete `- [ ]` task.
3. If the next task is an `**Agent Action**`:
    - Perform the necessary code changes to complete the action.
    - Validate the changes (e.g., run local unit tests or build commands if applicable).
    - Update the `GUIDE.md` file, changing the `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for the completed task.
    - Move on to the next task or pause if the next task requires the User.
4. If the next task is a `**User Action**` or requires external `**Validation**`:
    - Stop execution.
    - Prompt the User with specific instructions on what they need to do manually.
    - Wait for the User to confirm completion before continuing.
5. Periodically, at the end of a session or after major milestones, run the instructions in `SKILLS/CALCULATOR_SKILL.md` to update the `CALCULATOR.md` file and keep progress tracking up to date.
